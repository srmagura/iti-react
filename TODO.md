# Backlog

- Put all code in src directory in iti-react, and set "main" in package.json (is there actually any benefit to this?)
- Remove "as any" in render method of DateInput when @types/react-datepicker 2.0.0 becomes available
- Known issue: ValidatedSelect text overflow when typing a long search string  
  https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/2774
- Figure out why absolute imports don't work in the iti-react project
- switch TimeInput back to using native select for easier keyboard navigation?
