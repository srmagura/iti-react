- I think preventNonExistentPage needs to be used for DataUpdater even when AutoRefreshUpdater is not used. Confirm this and update documentation.
- Move FormCheck to iti-react?
- rename ActionDialog.loading to performingAction
- make onChildReady do nothing if value is already true

# Backlog

- Remove onChildReady rename onChildReady2 -> onChildReady
- Known issue: ValidatedSelect text overflow when typing a long search string
